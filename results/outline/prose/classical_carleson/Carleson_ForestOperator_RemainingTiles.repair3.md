You are correcting translations of verified Lean statements into mathematical English.
An independent checker found the English statements below unfaithful to the Lean. For each, write a corrected
statement in clear mathematical English (LaTeX between $...$), fixing the issue the checker raised. Be faithful to
the FULL Lean statement: keep every hypothesis, including the assumptions carried by instance arguments, stated in
words ("G is a finite abelian group", "μ is a probability measure", "X is a metric space"), and the exact
conclusion. Only instances with no mathematical content (decidability: `Decidable…`) may stay unstated. Never
replace an assumption by a stronger one, and state restrictive types (a natural number, a nonnegative real). For a
definition, name the setting its signature assumes. Keep citations and remarks only if the docstring or the Lean
supports them. Do not add
claims the Lean does not make; attribute anything beyond a definition's signature to its docstring.

### `TileStructure.Forest.𝓙₆`
Lean (short): `[ProofData a q K σ₁ σ₂ F G] [TileStructure Q (defaultD a) (defaultκ a) (defaultS X) (cancelPt X)] (t : Forest X n) (u₁ : 𝔓 X) : Set (Grid X)`
Lean (full): `{X : Type u_1} → {a : ℕ} → {q : ℝ} → {K : X → X → ℂ} → {σ₁ σ₂ : X → ℤ} → {F G : Set X} → [inst : MetricSpace X] → [inst_1 : ProofData a q K σ₁ σ₂ F G] → [inst_2 : TileStructure (Q (F := F) (G := G)) (defaultD a) (defaultκ a) (defaultS X (F := F) (G := G)) (cancelPt X)] → {n : ℕ} → Forest X (F := F) (G := G) n → 𝔓 X → Set (Grid X)`
Docstring: The definition `𝓙'` at the start of Section 7.6. We use a different notation to distinguish it from the 𝓙' used in Section 7.5
Previous English: For a forest $t$ and a tile $u_1$, defines the collection of dyadic cubes $\mathcal J_6(u_1)\subseteq\mathrm{Grid}(X)$, the set $\mathcal J'$ from the start of Section 7.6 (named differently to distinguish it from the $\mathcal J'$ of Section 7.5).
Checker's issue: The definition omits its setting: it never names the ProofData and TileStructure standing assumptions on the metric space X that the signature requires. Its identification with the J' of Section 7.6 is also not attributed to the docstring.
