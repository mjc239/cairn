You are correcting translations of verified Lean statements into mathematical English.
An independent checker found the English statements below unfaithful to the Lean. For each, write a corrected
statement in clear mathematical English (LaTeX between $...$), fixing the issue the checker raised. Be faithful to
the FULL Lean statement: keep every hypothesis, including the assumptions carried by instance arguments, stated in
words ("G is a finite abelian group", "μ is a probability measure", "X is a metric space"), and the exact
conclusion. Only instances with no mathematical content (decidability: `Decidable…`) may stay unstated. Never
replace an assumption by a stronger one, and state restrictive types (a natural number, a nonnegative real). For a
definition, name the setting its signature assumes. Keep citations and remarks only if the docstring or the Lean
supports them. Do not add
claims the Lean does not make; attribute anything beyond a definition's signature to its docstring, and when no
docstring, definition body (under "Project definitions") or Lean supports a description of an object, name it
instead of describing it. Give every variable its
type, introduce every symbol, and never use one letter for two things.

### `estimate_czOperator`
Lean (short): `[DoublingMeasure X ↑(defaultA a)] [IsTwoSidedKernel a K] (ha : 4 ≤ a) (hr : 0 < r) (hf : BoundedFiniteSupport f volume) (hT : HasBoundedStrongType (czOperator K r) 2 2 volume volume ↑(C_Ts a)) : distribution (czOperator K r f) α volume ≤ ↑(C10_0_3 a) / α * eLpNorm f 1 volume`
Lean (full): `∀ {X : Type u_1} {a : ℕ} [inst : MetricSpace X] [inst_1 : DoublingMeasure X ↑(defaultA a)] {r : ℝ} {K : X → X → ℂ} [IsTwoSidedKernel a K] {f : X → ℂ} {α : ENNReal}, (4 : ℕ) ≤ a → (0 : ℝ) < r → BoundedFiniteSupport f volume → HasBoundedStrongType (_x := MeasureSpace.toMeasurableSpace) (_x' := MeasureSpace.toMeasurableSpace) (czOperator K r) (2 : ENNReal) (2 : ENNReal) volume volume ↑(C_Ts a) → distribution (m := MeasureSpace.toMeasurableSpace) (czOperator K r f) α volume ≤ ↑(C10_0_3 a) / α * @eLpNorm _ _ _ MeasureSpace.toMeasurableSpace f (1 : ENNReal) volume`
Docstring: Lemma 10.0.3, blueprint form.
Previous English: (Lemma 10.0.3.) Let $X$ be a metric space with a doubling measure with doubling constant `defaultA a` (where $a \in \mathbb{N}$), and let $K : X \times X \to \mathbb{C}$ be a two-sided Calderón–Zygmund kernel with parameter $a$ (`IsTwoSidedKernel a K`). Let $a \ge 4$, $r > 0$, let $f : X \to \mathbb{C}$ be bounded with finite-measure support, and suppose $\mathrm{czOperator}(K, r)$ has bounded strong type $(2,2)$ with constant $C_{Ts}(a)$. Then for every $\alpha \in [0,\infty]$, the distribution function satisfies $\mathrm{vol}\{x : \|\mathrm{czOperator}(K, r) f(x)\| > \alpha\} \le \frac{C_{10.0.3}(a)}{\alpha} \|f\|_{L^1}$.
Checker's issue: Supplies unsupported descriptions of undefined objects: BoundedFiniteSupport as 'bounded with finite-measure support' (possibly dropping a measurability condition), an explicit formula for distribution, and IsTwoSidedKernel as a Calderon-Zygmund kernel. czOperator(K, r) is never introduced.
