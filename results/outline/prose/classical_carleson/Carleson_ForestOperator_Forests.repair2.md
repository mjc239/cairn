You are correcting translations of verified Lean statements into mathematical English.
An independent checker found the English statements below unfaithful to the Lean. For each, write a corrected
statement in clear mathematical English (LaTeX between $...$), fixing the issue the checker raised. Be faithful to
the FULL Lean statement: keep every hypothesis, including the assumptions carried by instance arguments, stated in
words ("G is a finite abelian group", "μ is a probability measure", "X is a metric space"), and the exact
conclusion. Only instances with no mathematical content (decidability: `Decidable…`) may stay unstated. Never
replace an assumption by a stronger one, and state restrictive types (a natural number, a nonnegative real). For a
definition, name the setting its signature assumes. Keep citations and remarks only if the docstring or the Lean
supports them. Do not add
claims the Lean does not make; attribute anything beyond a definition's signature to its docstring.

### `TileStructure.Forest.rowDecomp_𝔘`
Lean (short): `[ProofData a q K σ₁ σ₂ F G] [TileStructure Q (defaultD a) (defaultκ a) (defaultS X) (cancelPt X)] (t : Forest X n) (j : ℕ) : Set (𝔓 X)`
Lean (full): `{X : Type u_1} → {a : ℕ} → {q : ℝ} → {K : X → X → ℂ} → {σ₁ σ₂ : X → ℤ} → {F G : Set X} → [inst : MetricSpace X] → [inst_1 : ProofData a q K σ₁ σ₂ F G] → [inst_2 : TileStructure (Q (F := F) (G := G)) (defaultD a) (defaultκ a) (defaultS X (F := F) (G := G)) (cancelPt X)] → {n : ℕ} → Forest X (F := F) (G := G) n → ℕ → Set (𝔓 X)`
Previous English: For an $n$-forest $t$ and $j \in \mathbb{N}$, the set of tiles $\mathrm{rowDecomp}_{\mathfrak{U}}(t, j)$: the set of tree tops forming the $j$-th row in the row decomposition of $t$.
Checker's issue: The definition does not name the setting its signature assumes: a metric space X with the ProofData bundle and the TileStructure.

### `TileStructure.Forest.rowDecomp`
Lean (short): `[ProofData a q K σ₁ σ₂ F G] [TileStructure Q (defaultD a) (defaultκ a) (defaultS X) (cancelPt X)] (t : Forest X n) (j : ℕ) : Row X n`
Lean (full): `{X : Type u_1} → {a : ℕ} → {q : ℝ} → {K : X → X → ℂ} → {σ₁ σ₂ : X → ℤ} → {F G : Set X} → [inst : MetricSpace X] → [inst_1 : ProofData a q K σ₁ σ₂ F G] → [inst_2 : TileStructure (Q (F := F) (G := G)) (defaultD a) (defaultκ a) (defaultS X (F := F) (G := G)) (cancelPt X)] → {n : ℕ} → Forest X (F := F) (G := G) n → ℕ → Row X (F := F) (G := G) n`
Docstring: The row-decomposition of a tree, defined in the proof of Lemma 7.7.1. The indexing is off-by-one compared to the blueprint.
Previous English: For an $n$-forest $t$ and $j \in \mathbb{N}$, the $j$-th $n$-row of the row decomposition of $t$, as defined in the proof of Lemma 7.7.1 (with indexing shifted by one relative to the blueprint).
Checker's issue: The definition does not name the setting its signature assumes: a metric space X with the ProofData bundle and the TileStructure.
