You are correcting translations of verified Lean statements into mathematical English.
An independent checker found the English statements below unfaithful to the Lean. For each, write a corrected
statement in clear mathematical English (LaTeX between $...$), fixing the issue the checker raised. Be faithful to
the FULL Lean statement: keep every hypothesis, including the assumptions carried by instance arguments, stated in
words ("G is a finite abelian group", "μ is a probability measure", "X is a metric space"), and the exact
conclusion. Only instances with no mathematical content (decidability: `Decidable…`) may stay unstated. Never
replace an assumption by a stronger one, and state restrictive types (a natural number, a nonnegative real). For a
definition, name the setting its signature assumes. Keep citations and remarks only if the docstring or the Lean
supports them. Do not add
claims the Lean does not make; attribute anything beyond a definition's signature to its docstring.

### `MeasureTheory.cLpNorm`
Lean (short): `(p : ENNReal) (f : α → E) : ℝ`
Lean (full): `{α : Type u_1} → {E : Type u_4} → [MeasurableSpace α] → [NormedAddCommGroup E] → ENNReal → (α → E) → ℝ`
Docstring: The Lp norm of a function with the compact normalisation.
Previous English: For $p \in [0,\infty]$ and $f : \alpha \to E$, $\|f\|_{L^p}$ with the compact normalisation (averaging rather than summing over the domain) is defined as a real number.
Checker's issue: Omits the setting (α a measurable space, E a normed additive commutative group), and the 'compact normalisation (averaging)' gloss is not attributed to the docstring.
