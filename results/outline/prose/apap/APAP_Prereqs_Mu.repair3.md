You are correcting translations of verified Lean statements into mathematical English.
An independent checker found the English statements below unfaithful to the Lean. For each, write a corrected
statement in clear mathematical English (LaTeX between $...$), fixing the issue the checker raised. Be faithful to
the FULL Lean statement: keep every hypothesis, including the assumptions carried by instance arguments, stated in
words ("G is a finite abelian group", "μ is a probability measure", "X is a metric space"), and the exact
conclusion. Only instances with no mathematical content (decidability: `Decidable…`) may stay unstated. Never
replace an assumption by a stronger one, and state restrictive types (a natural number, a nonnegative real). For a
definition, name the setting its signature assumes. Keep citations and remarks only if the docstring or the Lean
supports them. Do not add
claims the Lean does not make; attribute anything beyond a definition's signature to its docstring, and when no
docstring, definition body (under "Project definitions") or Lean supports a description of an object, name it
instead of describing it. Give every variable its
type, introduce every symbol, and never use one letter for two things.

### `mu`
Lean (short): `(s : Finset α) (_ : α) : K`
Lean (full): `{K : Type u_1} → {α : Type u_3} → [DivisionSemiring K] → Finset α → α → K`
Docstring: The normalised indicator_one of a set.
Previous English: Definition. Let $K$ be a division semiring and $\alpha$ a type. For a finite set $s \subseteq \alpha$, $\mu_s : \alpha \to K$ is, per the docstring, "the normalised indicator of a set" $s$.
Checker's issue: Misquotes the docstring ('normalised indicator' vs. 'normalised indicator_one'); quote it exactly or paraphrase without quotation marks.
