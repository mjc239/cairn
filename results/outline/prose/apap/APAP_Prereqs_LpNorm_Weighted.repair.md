You are correcting translations of verified Lean statements into mathematical English.
An independent checker found the English statements below unfaithful to the Lean. For each, write a corrected
statement in clear mathematical English (LaTeX between $...$), fixing the issue the checker raised. Be faithful to
the FULL Lean statement: keep every hypothesis, including the assumptions carried by instance arguments, stated in
words ("G is a finite abelian group", "μ is a probability measure", "X is a metric space"), and the exact
conclusion. Only instances with no mathematical content (decidability: `Decidable…`) may stay unstated. Never
replace an assumption by a stronger one, and state restrictive types (a natural number, a nonnegative real). For a
definition, name the setting its signature assumes. Keep citations and remarks only if the docstring or the Lean
supports them. Do not add
claims the Lean does not make; attribute anything beyond a definition's signature to its docstring.

### `wLpNorm`
Lean (short): `(p : ENNReal) (w : α → NNReal) (f : α → E) : ℝ`
Lean (full): `{α : Type u_1} → {E : Type u_3} → [MeasurableSpace α] → [NormedAddCommGroup E] → ENNReal → (α → NNReal) → (α → E) → ℝ`
Docstring: The weighted Lp norm of a function.
Previous English: For $p \in [0, \infty]$, a weight $w : \alpha \to \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$ and $f : \alpha \to E$, defines the weighted $L^p$ norm $\|f\|_{p, w}$ of $f$.
Checker's issue: Omits that E is a normed additive commutative group.
