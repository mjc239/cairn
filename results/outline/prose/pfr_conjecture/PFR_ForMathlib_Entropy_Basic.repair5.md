You are correcting translations of verified Lean statements into mathematical English.
An independent checker found the English statements below unfaithful to the Lean. For each, write a corrected
statement in clear mathematical English (LaTeX between $...$), fixing the issue the checker raised. Be faithful to
the FULL Lean statement: keep every hypothesis, including the assumptions carried by instance arguments, stated in
words ("G is a finite abelian group", "μ is a probability measure", "X is a metric space"), and the exact
conclusion. Only instances with no mathematical content (decidability: `Decidable…`) may stay unstated. Never
replace an assumption by a stronger one, and state restrictive types (a natural number, a nonnegative real). For a
definition, name the setting its signature assumes. Keep citations and remarks only if the docstring or the Lean
supports them. Do not add
claims the Lean does not make; attribute anything beyond a definition's signature to its docstring, and when no
docstring, definition body (under "Project definitions") or Lean supports a description of an object, name it
instead of describing it. Give every variable its
type, introduce every symbol, and never use one letter for two things. When a definition's body is shown, say what
it defines, in words or a formula that agrees with the body.

(What each project notion is. Any description of one in the English must agree with this.)

#### `ProbabilityTheory.entropy` (def)
Lean: `{Ω : Type u_1} → {S : Type u_2} → [mΩ : MeasurableSpace Ω] → [MeasurableSpace S] → (Ω → S) → autoParam (Measure Ω) entropy._auto_1 → ℝ`
Docstring: Entropy of a random variable with values in a finite measurable space.
Definition: `fun {Ω : Type u_1} {S : Type u_2} [MeasurableSpace Ω] [MeasurableSpace S] (X : Ω → S) (μ : Measure Ω) => Hm[Measure.map X μ]`

#### `prod` (def)
Lean: `{Ω : Type u_1} → {S : Type u_2} → {T : Type u_3} → (Ω → S) → (Ω → T) → Ω → S × T`
Docstring: The pair of two random variables
Definition: `fun {Ω : Type u_1} {S : Type u_2} {T : Type u_3} (X : Ω → S) (Y : Ω → T) (ω : Ω) => (X ω, Y ω)`

#### `ProbabilityTheory.measureEntropy` (def)
Lean: `{S : Type u_2} → [inst : MeasurableSpace S] → autoParam (Measure S) measureEntropy._auto_1 → ℝ`
Docstring: Entropy of a measure on a measurable space. We normalize the measure by `(μ Set.univ)⁻¹` to extend the entropy definition to finite measures. What we really want to do is deal with `μ=0` or `IsProbabilityMeasure μ`, but we don't have a typeclass for that (we could create one though). The added complexity ∈ the expression is not an issue because if `μ` is a probability measure, a call to `simp` will simplify `(μ Set.univ)⁻¹ • μ` to `μ`.
Definition: `fun {S : Type u_2} [MeasurableSpace S] (μ : Measure S) => ∑' (s : S), ((HSMul.hSMul (α := ENNReal) ((μ Set.univ)⁻¹ : ENNReal) μ).real {s}).negMulLog`

### `ProbabilityTheory.mutualInfo`
Lean (short): `(X : Ω → S) (Y : Ω → T) (μ : autoParam (Measure Ω) mutualInfo._auto_1) : ℝ`
Lean (full): `{Ω : Type u_1} → {S : Type u_2} → {T : Type u_3} → [mΩ : MeasurableSpace Ω] → [MeasurableSpace S] → [MeasurableSpace T] → (Ω → S) → (Ω → T) → autoParam (Measure Ω) mutualInfo._auto_1 → ℝ`
Definition: `fun {Ω : Type u_1} {S : Type u_2} {T : Type u_3} [MeasurableSpace Ω] [MeasurableSpace S] [MeasurableSpace T] (X : Ω → S) (Y : Ω → T) (μ : Measure Ω) => H[X; μ] + H[Y; μ] - H[⟨X, Y⟩; μ]`
Docstring: The mutual information `I[X : Y]` of two random variables is defined to be `H[X] + H[Y] - H[X ; Y]`.
Previous English: Let $\Omega$, $S$ and $T$ be measurable spaces. Definition: for functions $X : \Omega\to S$, $Y : \Omega\to T$ and a measure $\mu$ on $\Omega$ (if omitted, $\mu$ is filled in automatically as `volume`, the measure of a `MeasureSpace` instance on $\Omega$), the real number $I[X : Y;\mu]$. According to the docstring, the mutual information of two random variables is defined to be $H[X]+H[Y]-H[(X,Y)]$, where $(X,Y):\Omega\to S\times T$ is the pair $\omega\mapsto(X(\omega),Y(\omega))$ and $H$ denotes entropy.
Checker's issue: Reads the docstring's H[X ; Y] as the entropy of the pair (X,Y); support this from the definition body under Project definitions, or state it as the docstring does.
