You are correcting translations of verified Lean statements into mathematical English.
An independent checker found the English statements below unfaithful to the Lean. For each, write a corrected
statement in clear mathematical English (LaTeX between $...$), fixing the issue the checker raised. Be faithful to
the FULL Lean statement: keep every hypothesis, including the assumptions carried by instance arguments, stated in
words ("G is a finite abelian group", "μ is a probability measure", "X is a metric space"), and the exact
conclusion. Only instances with no mathematical content (decidability: `Decidable…`) may stay unstated. Never
replace an assumption by a stronger one. For a definition, name the setting its signature assumes. Do not add
claims the Lean does not make; attribute anything beyond a definition's signature to its docstring.

### `ProbabilityTheory.Kernel.rdist`
Lean (short): `(κ : Kernel T G) (η : Kernel T' G) (μ : Measure T) (ν : Measure T') : ℝ`
Lean (full): `{T : Type u_1} → {T' : Type u_2} → {G : Type u_4} → [inst : MeasurableSpace T] → [inst_1 : MeasurableSpace T'] → [inst_2 : MeasurableSpace G] → [AddCommGroup G] → Kernel T G → Kernel T' G → Measure T → Measure T' → ℝ`
Docstring: The Rusza distance between two kernels taking values in the same space, defined as the average Rusza distance between the image measures.
Previous English: For kernels $\kappa$ from $T$ to $G$ and $\eta$ from $T'$ to $G$ (with values in the same group $G$) and measures $\mu$ on $T$ and $\nu$ on $T'$, the kernel Ruzsa distance $d_k[\kappa;\mu \,\#\, \eta;\nu]$ is the average of the Ruzsa distances $\mathrm{rdistm}(\kappa(t),\eta(t'))$ between the image measures, averaged over $(t,t')$ with respect to $\mu\times\nu$.
Checker's issue: Says only 'the same group G' where the Lean requires G to be an abelian group (AddCommGroup G).
