You are correcting translations of verified Lean statements into mathematical English.
An independent checker found the English statements below unfaithful to the Lean. For each, write a corrected
statement in clear mathematical English (LaTeX between $...$), fixing the issue the checker raised. Be faithful to
the FULL Lean statement: keep every hypothesis, including the assumptions carried by instance arguments, stated in
words ("G is a finite abelian group", "μ is a probability measure", "X is a metric space"), and the exact
conclusion. Only instances with no mathematical content (decidability: `Decidable…`) may stay unstated. Never
replace an assumption by a stronger one, and state restrictive types (a natural number, a nonnegative real). For a
definition, name the setting its signature assumes. Keep citations and remarks only if the docstring or the Lean
supports them. Do not add
claims the Lean does not make; attribute anything beyond a definition's signature to its docstring, and when no
docstring, definition body (under "Project definitions") or Lean supports a description of an object, name it
instead of describing it. Give every variable its
type, introduce every symbol, and never use one letter for two things. When a definition's body is shown, say what
it defines, in words or a formula that agrees with the body.

#### `refPackage.X₀₁` (def)
Lean: `{Ω₀₁ : Type u_1} → {Ω₀₂ : Type u_2} → [inst : MeasureSpace Ω₀₁] → [inst_1 : MeasureSpace Ω₀₂] → {G : Type uG} → [inst_2 : MeasurableSpace G] → refPackage Ω₀₁ Ω₀₂ G → Ω₀₁ → G`
Docstring: The first variable in a package.
Definition: `fun (Ω₀₁ : Type u_1) (Ω₀₂ : Type u_2) [MeasureSpace Ω₀₁] [MeasureSpace Ω₀₂] (G : Type uG) [MeasurableSpace G] (self : refPackage Ω₀₁ Ω₀₂ G) => self.1`

#### `refPackage.X₀₂` (def)
Lean: `{Ω₀₁ : Type u_1} → {Ω₀₂ : Type u_2} → [inst : MeasureSpace Ω₀₁] → [inst_1 : MeasureSpace Ω₀₂] → {G : Type uG} → [inst_2 : MeasurableSpace G] → refPackage Ω₀₁ Ω₀₂ G → Ω₀₂ → G`
Docstring: The second variable in a package.
Definition: `fun (Ω₀₁ : Type u_1) (Ω₀₂ : Type u_2) [MeasureSpace Ω₀₁] [MeasureSpace Ω₀₂] (G : Type uG) [MeasurableSpace G] (self : refPackage Ω₀₁ Ω₀₂ G) => self.2`

#### `refPackage.η` (def)
Lean: `{Ω₀₁ : Type u_1} → {Ω₀₂ : Type u_2} → [inst : MeasureSpace Ω₀₁] → [inst_1 : MeasureSpace Ω₀₂] → {G : Type uG} → [inst_2 : MeasurableSpace G] → refPackage Ω₀₁ Ω₀₂ G → ℝ`
Docstring: The constant that parameterizes how good the package is. The argument only works for small enough `η`, typically `≤ 1/9` or `< 1/8`.
Definition: `fun (Ω₀₁ : Type u_1) (Ω₀₂ : Type u_2) [MeasureSpace Ω₀₁] [MeasureSpace Ω₀₂] (G : Type uG) [MeasurableSpace G] (self : refPackage Ω₀₁ Ω₀₂ G) => self.5`

#### `rdist` (def)
Lean: `{Ω : Type u_1} → {Ω' : Type u_2} → {G : Type u_5} → [mΩ : MeasurableSpace Ω] → [mΩ' : MeasurableSpace Ω'] → [hG : MeasurableSpace G] → [AddCommGroup G] → (Ω → G) → (Ω' → G) → autoParam (Measure Ω) rdist._auto_1 → autoParam (Measure Ω') rdist._auto_3 → ℝ`
Docstring: The Ruzsa distance `rdist X Y` or `d[X ; Y]` between two random variables is defined as `H[X'- Y'] - H[X']/2 - H[Y']/2`, where `X', Y'` are independent copies of `X, Y`.
Definition: `fun {Ω : Type u_1} {Ω' : Type u_2} {G : Type u_5} [MeasurableSpace Ω] [MeasurableSpace Ω'] [MeasurableSpace G] [AddCommGroup G] (X : Ω → G) (Y : Ω' → G) (μ : Measure Ω) (μ' : Measure Ω') => H[fun (x : G × G) => x.1 - x.2; Measure.prod (Measure.map X μ) (Measure.map Y μ')] - H[X; μ] / (2 : ℝ) - H[Y; μ'] / (2 : ℝ)`

#### `ProbabilityTheory.entropy` (def)
Lean: `{Ω : Type u_1} → {S : Type u_2} → [mΩ : MeasurableSpace Ω] → [MeasurableSpace S] → (Ω → S) → autoParam (Measure Ω) entropy._auto_1 → ℝ`
Docstring: Entropy of a random variable with values in a finite measurable space.
Definition: `fun {Ω : Type u_1} {S : Type u_2} [MeasurableSpace Ω] [MeasurableSpace S] (X : Ω → S) (μ : Measure Ω) => Hm[Measure.map X μ]`

#### `ProbabilityTheory.measureEntropy` (def)
Lean: `{S : Type u_2} → [inst : MeasurableSpace S] → autoParam (Measure S) measureEntropy._auto_1 → ℝ`
Docstring: Entropy of a measure on a measurable space. We normalize the measure by `(μ Set.univ)⁻¹` to extend the entropy definition to finite measures. What we really want to do is deal with `μ=0` or `IsProbabilityMeasure μ`, but we don't have a typeclass for that (we could create one though). The added complexity ∈ the expression is not an issue because if `μ` is a probability measure, a call to `simp` will simplify `(μ Set.univ)⁻¹ • μ` to `μ`.
Definition: `fun {S : Type u_2} [MeasurableSpace S] (μ : Measure S) => ∑' (s : S), ((HSMul.hSMul (α := ENNReal) ((μ Set.univ)⁻¹ : ENNReal) μ).real {s}).negMulLog`

### `refPackage`
Lean (short): `(Ω₀₁ : Type u_1) (Ω₀₂ : Type u_2) (G : Type uG) : Type (max (max uG u_1) u_2)`
Lean (full): `(Ω₀₁ : Type u_1) → (Ω₀₂ : Type u_2) → [MeasureSpace Ω₀₁] → [MeasureSpace Ω₀₂] → (G : Type uG) → [MeasurableSpace G] → Type (max (max uG u_1) u_2)`
Constructor (every field with its type): `{Ω₀₁ : Type u_1} → {Ω₀₂ : Type u_2} → [inst : MeasureSpace Ω₀₁] → [inst_1 : MeasureSpace Ω₀₂] → {G : Type uG} → [inst_2 : MeasurableSpace G] → (X₀₁ : Ω₀₁ → G) → (X₀₂ : Ω₀₂ → G) → Measurable X₀₁ → Measurable X₀₂ → (η : ℝ) → (0 : ℝ) < η → (8 : ℝ) * η ≤ (1 : ℝ) → refPackage Ω₀₁ Ω₀₂ G`
Docstring: A structure that packages all the fixed information in the main argument. In this way, when defining the τ functional, we will only only need to refer to the package once in the notation instead of stating the reference spaces, the reference measures and the reference random variables. The η parameter has now been incorporated into the package, in preparation for being able to manipulate the package.
Previous English: For measure spaces $\Omega_{01}$ and $\Omega_{02}$ (types each equipped with a canonical measure) and a measurable space $G$, `refPackage Ω₀₁ Ω₀₂ G` is a type (a structure). According to its docstring, it packages all the fixed information in the main argument, so that when defining the $\tau$ functional one only needs to refer to the package once in the notation instead of stating the reference spaces, the reference measures and the reference random variables; the docstring adds that the parameter $\eta$ has been incorporated into the package.
Checker's issue: The structure's constructor fields are shown but the English only paraphrases the docstring. It never says what a package consists of: measurable X₀₁ : Ω₀₁ → G and X₀₂ : Ω₀₂ → G, and a real η with 0 < η and 8η ≤ 1.

### `tau`
Lean (short): `(p : refPackage Ω₀₁ Ω₀₂ G) (X₁ : Ω₁ → G) (X₂ : Ω₂ → G) (μ₁ : Measure Ω₁) (μ₂ : Measure Ω₂) : ℝ`
Lean (full): `{Ω₀₁ : Type u_1} → {Ω₀₂ : Type u_2} → [inst : MeasureSpace Ω₀₁] → [inst_1 : MeasureSpace Ω₀₂] → {G : Type uG} → [AddCommGroup G] → [inst_3 : MeasurableSpace G] → refPackage Ω₀₁ Ω₀₂ G → {Ω₁ : Type u_11} → {Ω₂ : Type u_12} → [inst : MeasurableSpace Ω₁] → [inst_4 : MeasurableSpace Ω₂] → (Ω₁ → G) → (Ω₂ → G) → Measure Ω₁ → Measure Ω₂ → ℝ`
Definition: `fun {Ω₀₁ : Type u_1} {Ω₀₂ : Type u_2} [MeasureSpace Ω₀₁] [MeasureSpace Ω₀₂] {G : Type uG} [AddCommGroup G] [MeasurableSpace G] (p : refPackage Ω₀₁ Ω₀₂ G) {Ω₁ : Type u_11} {Ω₂ : Type u_12} [MeasurableSpace Ω₁] [MeasurableSpace Ω₂] (X₁ : Ω₁ → G) (X₂ : Ω₂ → G) (μ₁ : Measure Ω₁) (μ₂ : Measure Ω₂) => d[X₁; μ₁ # X₂; μ₂] + p.η * d[p.X₀₁; volume # X₁; μ₁] + p.η * d[p.X₀₂; volume # X₂; μ₂]`
Docstring: If $X_1,X_2$ are two $G$-valued random variables, then $$ \tau[X_1; X_2] := d[X_1; X_2] + \eta d[X^0_1; X_1] + \eta d[X^0_2; X_2].$$ Here, $X^0_1$ and $X^0_2$ are two random variables fixed once and for all in most of the argument. To lighten notation, We package `X^0_1` and `X^0_2` in a single object named `p`. We denote it as `τ[X₁ ; μ₁ # X₂ ; μ₂ | p]` where `p` is a fixed package containing the information of the reference random variables. When the measurable spaces have a canonical measure `ℙ`, we can use `τ[X₁ # X₂ | p]`
Previous English: Let $\Omega_{01}$ and $\Omega_{02}$ be measure spaces, let $G$ be an abelian group (additive commutative group) equipped with a measurable space structure, and let $p$ be a reference package `refPackage Ω₀₁ Ω₀₂ G`. For measurable spaces $\Omega_1, \Omega_2$, functions $X_1 : \Omega_1 \to G$ and $X_2 : \Omega_2 \to G$, and measures $\mu_1$ on $\Omega_1$ and $\mu_2$ on $\Omega_2$, define a real number $\tau[X_1; \mu_1 \# X_2; \mu_2 \mid p]$. According to its docstring, $\tau[X_1; X_2] := d[X_1; X_2] + \eta\, d[X^0_1; X_1] + \eta\, d[X^0_2; X_2]$, where $X^0_1, X^0_2$ are reference random variables fixed once and for all and packaged in $p$.
Checker's issue: The body is described only through the docstring, and the docstring formula leaves symbols unintroduced: d is never identified as the Ruzsa distance, η is not said to be p.η, and the measures are not stated (d[X₁;μ₁ # X₂;μ₂] + p.η·d[p.X₀₁; volume # X₁; μ₁] + p.η·d[p.X₀₂; volume # X₂; μ₂]).

### `TauMinimizes`
Lean (short): `(p : refPackage Ω₀₁ Ω₀₂ G) (X₁ : Ω → G) (X₂ : Ω → G) : Prop`
Lean (full): `{Ω₀₁ : Type u_1} → {Ω₀₂ : Type u_2} → [inst : MeasureSpace Ω₀₁] → [inst_1 : MeasureSpace Ω₀₂] → {G : Type uG} → [AddCommGroup G] → [inst_3 : MeasurableSpace G] → refPackage Ω₀₁ Ω₀₂ G → {Ω : Type u_11} → [MeasureSpace Ω] → (Ω → G) → (Ω → G) → Prop`
Definition: `fun {Ω₀₁ : Type u_1} {Ω₀₂ : Type u_2} [MeasureSpace Ω₀₁] [MeasureSpace Ω₀₂] {G : Type uG} [AddCommGroup G] [MeasurableSpace G] (p : refPackage Ω₀₁ Ω₀₂ G) {Ω : Type u_11} [MeasureSpace Ω] (X₁ X₂ : Ω → G) => ∀ (ν₁ : Measure G) [IsProbabilityMeasure ν₁] (ν₂ : Measure G) [IsProbabilityMeasure ν₂], τ[X₁ # X₂ | p] ≤ τ[id ; ν₁ # id ; ν₂ | p]`
Docstring: Property recording the fact that two random variables minimize the tau functional. Expressed in terms of measures on the group to avoid quantifying over all spaces, but this implies comparison with any pair of random variables, see Lemma `is_tau_min`.
Previous English: Let $\Omega_{01}$ and $\Omega_{02}$ be measure spaces, let $G$ be an abelian group (additive commutative group) equipped with a measurable space structure, and let $p$ be a reference package `refPackage Ω₀₁ Ω₀₂ G`. For a measure space $\Omega$ and functions $X_1, X_2 : \Omega \to G$, `TauMinimizes p X₁ X₂` is a proposition. According to its docstring, it records the fact that $X_1, X_2$ minimize the $\tau$ functional; it is expressed in terms of measures on the group to avoid quantifying over all spaces, but it implies comparison with any pair of random variables (see Lemma `is_tau_min`).
Checker's issue: The body is not described, only the docstring is paraphrased. The body is: for all probability measures ν₁, ν₂ on G, τ[X₁ # X₂ | p] (with the canonical measure of Ω) ≤ τ[id; ν₁ # id; ν₂ | p].
